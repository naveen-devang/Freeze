# Builds mediaremote-adapter (BSD-3-Clause, https://github.com/ungive/mediaremote-adapter), which
# reads macOS now playing, into pc-companion/src-tauri/mediaremote/ for the macOS release bundle
# (src-tauri/tauri.macos-release.conf.json). MEDIAREMOTE_FULL_TEST=1 also runs the adapter's own
# end-to-end test, which needs a logged-in session.
# The adapter needs macOS 11 (UniformTypeIdentifiers). On 10.15 Freeze runs without now playing.

# Freeze runs the adapter in /usr/bin/perl as its child. A child that touches AppKit (the adapter
# watches NSWorkspace) is registered by macOS as another instance of the parent app, so the Dock
# showed a second Freeze icon that bounced for as long as the stream ran, and came back when it was
# force quit. Marking the process background-only before AppKit registers it keeps it out of the
# Dock (LaunchServices reads the main bundle's in-memory Info dictionary). Priority 101 runs this
# before the adapter's own constructor.
